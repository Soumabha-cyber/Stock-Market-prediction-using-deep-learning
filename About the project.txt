Projject of stock market prediction 

We are going to analyze the stock market data and build a deep learning model 
which can predict the future stock price based on previous data. 

In this project we do

1. Scrapping the Stock market data and Technical indicator data.
2. Performing Data Processing on Time Series data. 
3. Creating and training a Sequential model on Tensorflow 2.0 

Prerequisites

Basic Understanding on Artificial neural networks and Recurrent neural networks Working and Implementation.

Understanding stock market
Shares:
1. A stock or an equity is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. 
2. It entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. 
3. These units of stock are called "shares."
Market:
1. The stock market is the collection of markets. and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of 
shares of publicly held companies take place.

EXAMPLE

1. Imagine I have a company worth 10 million dollars. People have good trust in my company and I wanted to list my company 
   stock on an exchange like “New york stock exchange”.
2. But before going into public, I would divide my company total evaluation into 60, 40.
3. 6 Million worth of assets is still under my control and 4 million worth assets.To be sold to people who want to be a part 
   of company's growth. 
4. Before selling those 4 million dollars of my company’s evaluation and I would price my each share as 1 dollar. 
5. So, I am listing 4 million dollars worth of the company's evaluation as 4 million shares in an exchange. 
//
6. Once the shares are listed on exchange and they are openly traded, it all depends on buyers and sellers. 
7. If the buyers kept buying the stock, the supply of stock circulating on exchange decreases and we all know when supply 
   decreases the demand increases which increases the price of stock and eventually the company’s market evaluation.
//
8. As the founder of the company and 60 percent stock stockholder, I can sell little percentages of my
   stock when the prices are high.
9. That will help me raise money for the company's expansion.




Stock market investments generate great profits and is a fundamental stimulus for most of the market researchers in this area. 
Most researchers use either technical or fundamental analysis. 


		Technical Analysis						Fundamental Analysis

1. Technical analysis focuses on analyzing the 			1. Fundamental analysis depends on analyzing unstructured 
   direction of prices to predict future prices.		   textual information like financial news and earning reports. 
2. You might have come across people drawing 			2. Performing fundamental analysis using machine learning 
   different lines and curves on the price chart 		   techniques is quite interesting as it's mostly based 
   to predict the future price direction			   on analysing text and sentiments.
3. This is technical analysis					3. We see the stock price of companies tend to rise when 
								   their products get a word of mouth or they make a surprise 
								   announcement.This rise is due to fundamentals.

We can fetch data from social media websites like Twitter but we often don’t get the outcomes of it. 
In simple words, we need to solve the problem statement in an unsupervised way which could be a hit or miss in many situations.

(( Technical analysis is a pure number game where we have a bunch of numeric past information which has to be mapped to a number 
which we expect to be the future price which suits to be a perfect problem ))

------------------------
So in this project, our aim is to design a deep learning model that does the predictions based on technical analysis, which 
means the data that we are going to fetch would be having the price information at a regular time interval with its respective 
characteristics.The problem statement here comes under regression type, where the features are made up of past data feeds and 
target is the current value.
------------------------

The dataset in this project is going to be fetched from open source Python libraries.
*********************
The open source API that we are going to use for fetching the stock data is "YFINANCE", YFinance
offers a reliable threaded and Pythonic way to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

*********************************************
The columns in a dataset are

-------The trades on the stock market happen between two time intervals--------- 
-------The Trading Session for New york stock exchange is between 9:30am and 4pm--------
-------As company’s stock is openly traded, it's up to people’s sentiment to drive it High or Low----------

Date-
Open- The stock price at 9:30am is called Open
High- When any stock is available that perople are ready to buy in high price for surprise output
Low- When stock product dont get what they expected so it shorts the stocks.
Close- price at 4:00pm is called Close. 
Adj Close- The adjusted closing price amends a stock's closing price to reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions.
Volume- Trading volume is a measure of how much of a given financial asset has traded in a period of time. 


How stock price works
--------------------
--------------------
Suppose if Google announces a surprise event and reveals some awesome products.
Then it's very likely that people will push prices higher the next day when Trading opens. 
If Google server crashes or their products slow down and people are very angry at their service on Twitter and other social networks.
It's very likely that people will short the stock next day when Trading opens. 

The indicators that determine the highest and least values of a particular stock traded that day are high and low, respectively.

ADJUSTED CLOSE -
1. Considering the stock price of google as 1750 US dollars, we know that it's quite expensive to own 1 stock of google. 
2. What If Google splits its stock into 100 splits and the price of each split is 17.5$, then it would be easy for an individual to hold 1 stock of google.
3. Splitting doesn’t affect the market evaluation company, but it has a quite a lot of psychological impact on new buyers to own the stock. 
4. In this case all the previous closing values are divided by 100, to get the adjusted closing price. 

VOLUME -
1. Trading volume is a measure of how much of a given financial asset has traded in a period of time. 
2. For stocks, volume is measured in the number of shares traded.
3. Volume determines the market interest and liquidity of a particular stock.
4. If a stock volume is gradually decreasing with a constant or decrease in price of that stock, it means people are losing interest in investing in that company. 
5. If a stock volume is gradually increasing with a constant or increase in price of that stock, it means people are gaining interest in investing in that company.

In this model we use scarpping to get some features to improve our model's performance

Before investing, I would like to look at a few important indicators that would help me understand whether it is the right time to enter

Investors analyze a lot of technical indicators of the stock and buy it if the stock pattern seems favourable. 
Few of the Technical Indicators are: 
1. Moving averages.
2. MacD.
3. Bollinger Bands.
4. Fibonacci retracement.
5. Relative strength Index or RSI.

The RSI indicator seems the best feature that could be integrated into the model. others are tough to pass in the model
Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent 
price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset.

---------EXAMPLE--------

Anywhere we see the RSI greater than 70 points.

Then we call that the market is overbought and the price jump can happen any time.
And if the RSI is less than 30 points, then we call the market is oversold.
And if the company holds potential, then the investors would crazily buy the stock.


---------
---------
We use open source API provided by https://www.alphavantage.co/ to fetch the RSI data

--------------- SUMMARY----------

We learnt how to Fetch stock market data using Yfinance API.
We learnt how to process the stock market data before passing it into the model, you can make use of these steps in any time series projects.
Analyzed the results of our initial model and addressed the issue with it. 
The “technical indicators” and how they can help in making decisions. 
We scrapped the extra information and retrained the same model which improved the previous results. 

Ways to Improve the model
1. We can also fetch a few more indicators like Exponential Moving averages or Fibonacci retracement regions and retrain our model which may improve the results.
2. Before solving the problem statement like stock market prediction we need to perfectly understand the market sentiments and how the market reacts at different situations. 
3. We have solved this problem statement in a regression perspective where we tried to predict a continuous value.
4. Convert the same problem statement into “Classification” where the problem statement would be “Predict whether stock price of tomorrow is going to be greater than today or not”. 
5. It will reduce the complexity of the problem and there would be better metrics like “Accuracy” or “Recall” to evaluate the model.
